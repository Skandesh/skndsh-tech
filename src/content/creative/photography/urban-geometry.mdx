## Finding Order in Concrete

Cities are accidents of history layered into patterns. Each building negotiates with its neighbors. Each street finds its path through resistance.

This series documents moments where that negotiation produces unexpected geometry. Where accident becomes structure. Where the chaos of urban development crystallizes into form.

I am drawn to edges. The line where one material meets another. The shadow that defines a plane. The repetition that creates rhythm.

> Architecture is frozen music. Photography is the sheet music.

## The Camera as Editor

These images are not documentation. They are interpretation.

The frame excludes more than it includes. The angle flattens or exaggerates. The moment chosen from a million possible moments tells a particular story.

I am not capturing the building. I am capturing what the building makes me feel—translated through the limited vocabulary of light and composition.

## On Black and White

Some of these images desaturate naturally in my mind. The color becomes noise, distracting from the essential geometry.

Others demand color—where the material palette is part of the statement, where the warmth of light matters to the mood.

I let the image tell me what it wants to be.
