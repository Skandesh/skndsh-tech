## Chasing Photons

Light is the only thing a camera can record. Everything else—form, texture, color, mood—is an interpretation of how light behaves when it encounters matter.

These studies strip away the pretense of subject. There is no story here. No narrative. Only the interaction of electromagnetic radiation and surface.

## The Golden Hours

Most of these images were captured in the liminal moments—dawn and dusk, when the sun angles low and light takes on character.

Midday light is a floodlight. It illuminates but does not reveal. The shadows are harsh, the contrast unforgiving.

But early and late, light becomes dimensional. It wraps around forms. It creates atmosphere. It becomes, paradoxically, visible.

> We photograph light. We think we photograph objects.

## Technical Notes

Long exposures blur the boundaries. Multiple exposures layer realities. Intentional motion abstracts the concrete.

These are not tricks. They are explorations of what the camera can see that the eye cannot—not better vision, but different vision.

The camera is not a recording device. It is an instrument for seeing differently.
