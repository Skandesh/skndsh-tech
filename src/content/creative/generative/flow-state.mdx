## The Concept

Flow state is that moment when thought dissolves into action. When the boundary between observer and observed collapses. This piece attempts to visualize that dissolution.

Eight hundred particles move through a noise-generated flow field. Each one following invisible currents, tracing paths through mathematical space. The cursor becomes a gravitational anomaly—a point of attraction that bends the field around your presence.

> The goal is not control. The goal is participation.

## Technical Notes

The flow field is generated using layered sinusoidal functions to create organic, non-repeating patterns. Each particle has a limited lifespan, fading in at birth and fading out at death, creating a constant cycle of emergence and dissolution.

Mouse interaction adds a radial force that attracts nearby particles. The strength falls off with distance, creating a subtle gravitational effect rather than a harsh redirect.

## On Generative Art

There is something profound about systems that run without us. We set the initial conditions, define the rules, and then step back. The art happens in the running.

This is not illustration. This is not animation in the traditional sense. It is a process made visible. A system given form.

The particle does not know it is beautiful. It simply moves according to its nature. And somehow, in that pure adherence to mathematical law, beauty emerges.
