## The Algorithm of Togetherness

In 1986, Craig Reynolds asked a simple question: how do birds flock? The answer became one of the most elegant algorithms in computer science—three rules that produce infinite complexity.

**Separation.** Avoid crowding neighbors. Each agent steers away from those too close.

**Alignment.** Match velocity with neighbors. Move in the same direction as those around you.

**Cohesion.** Steer toward the average position of neighbors. Stay with the group.

> Three rules. No leader. Emergent order.

## Collective Intelligence

There is no commander in a murmuration of starlings. No central planner in a school of fish. Yet they move as one—a single organism made of many.

This is collective intelligence. It emerges when individual agents follow simple rules while responding to their local environment. The global pattern is not designed; it happens.

## Playing with the Sliders

The controls expose the three fundamental forces:

**Separation** controls personal space. High values create spread-out formations. Low values allow tight clusters.

**Alignment** controls synchronization. High values produce unified directional flow. Low values create chaotic, independent movement.

**Cohesion** controls group loyalty. High values pull the swarm tight. Low values let agents drift apart.

The cursor acts as a predator—the swarm avoids it. Watch how the formation adapts, splits, and reforms around the threat.

## What Emergence Teaches

The swarm knows things no individual knows. It finds paths through obstacles. It responds to threats faster than any single member could. It has properties—shape, direction, density—that exist only at the collective level.

Perhaps consciousness works this way. Billions of neurons following local rules, producing something neither planned nor centralized. A mind emerging from the mathematics of connection.
