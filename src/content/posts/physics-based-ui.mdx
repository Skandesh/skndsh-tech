# WHY EASING ISN&apos;T ENOUGH

Most animations use &quot;easing curves&quot; (ease-in, ease-out). They are predefined paths: &quot;Move from A to B in 0.5 seconds.&quot; But real life doesn&apos;t work like that. In real life, if I interrupt a moving object, it carries its momentum. Easing curves can&apos;t handle interruption—they just snap to a new path. It feels fake.

# HOOKE&apos;S LAW

To make UI feel &quot;real&quot;, we simulate a spring. A spring is defined by Hooke&apos;s Law: `F = -k * x`. The force pulling it back is proportional to how far you stretched it.

But a spring alone oscillates forever. We need friction (damping) to stop it. The full equation for our UI spring is:

`Acceleration = (-Stiffness * Displacement) - (Damping * Velocity)`

```typescript
class Spring {
  private position: number = 0;
  private velocity: number = 0;
  private target: number = 0;

  // Configuration
  private stiffness: number = 120; // Tension (k)
  private damping: number = 20;    // Friction (b)
  private mass: number = 1;        // Mass (m)

  update(deltaTime: number) {
    // 1. Calculate distance to target
    const displacement = this.position - this.target;

    // 2. Calculate Spring Force (Hooke's Law)
    // F_spring = -k * x
    const springForce = -this.stiffness * displacement;

    // 3. Calculate Damping Force (Friction)
    // F_damping = -b * v
    const dampingForce = -this.damping * this.velocity;

    // 4. Newton's Second Law: F = ma -> a = F/m
    const acceleration = (springForce + dampingForce) / this.mass;

    // 5. Integrate Physics
    this.velocity += acceleration * deltaTime; // Update velocity
    this.position += this.velocity * deltaTime; // Update position

    return this.position;
  }
}
```

This code runs every frame (60 times a second). Unlike a CSS transition, this system is &quot;interruptible&quot;. If the user grabs the object mid-animation, we just update the `velocity` based on their throw. The math handles the rest, preserving the momentum perfectly. This is why iOS animations feel so &quot;heavy&quot; and responsive compared to the web.
