The alarm sounds. The day begins.

There is a choice in this moment that shapes everything that follows. A fork in the path that most of us do not notice because we are already reaching for the phone, already scrolling, already somewhere else.

But there is another way.

## The First Hour

The ancient traditions speak of the hours before dawn as sacred. Brahma Muhurta, the time of creation. When the world is quiet and the mind is clear.

I do not wake at 4 AM. I am not a saint. But I have learned to protect the first hour. To treat it as something precious. To resist the gravitational pull of the inbox.

The screen will wait. It has infinite patience. It will be there in an hour, unchanged. The opportunity to begin the day in stillness will not.

## A Simple Practice

I do not prescribe. What works for me may not work for you. But I will describe what I do, in case it is useful.

I sit. Not on a cushion—just a chair. The same chair I will code in later. But now, the laptop is closed. The phone is in another room.

I breathe. Not in any special way. Just noticing the breath that is already happening. The rise. The fall. The pause between.

I do not try to stop thinking. Thoughts come. They always come. I notice them like weather. Clouds passing through a sky that was here before them and will remain after.

This lasts somewhere between ten minutes and thirty, depending on the day. There is no timer. When it feels complete, I stop.

> The practice is not what I do. The practice is that I show up.

## The Transition

Between the sitting and the screen, there is a gap. In that gap, I make tea. I look out the window. I do small physical things that do not require thought.

This transition matters. It is the bridge between the inner world and the outer. If I rush it, I carry the scattered energy of hurrying into my work. If I allow it, I carry the stillness forward.

The quality of my morning coding depends on this transition more than on the code itself.

## Why This Matters

I am a programmer. My work is abstract. I manipulate symbols on a screen. The temptation is to believe that my mental state does not matter. That code is code, regardless of who writes it or in what condition.

This is not true.

Code written in anxiety carries anxiety. You can feel it in the structure. In the over-engineering that betrays fear. In the shortcuts that reveal impatience. In the comments that sound defensive.

Code written in clarity is different. It is simple without being simplistic. It does what is needed, no more. It trusts the reader. It breathes.

I want to write the second kind of code. This morning practice is how I prepare to do so.

## The Return

The practice does not end when I open the laptop. It continues throughout the day. Every time I notice tension, I return to the breath. Every time I feel reactive, I pause before responding.

The morning practice is not a magic pill. It is a tuning. It raises the baseline. It makes the return easier when I inevitably drift.

And I always drift. That is the nature of the mind. It forgets. It gets caught. It identifies with the drama of the moment.

But somewhere, underneath the noise, the stillness remains. The morning practice reminds me that it is there. And in remembering, I find my way back.

The screen awaits. The code awaits. But first, this breath. This moment. This morning before the screen.
